## Research Question
- Multi-parent crossover
  - Parent pool size (20?)
  - Diagonal crossover / Random cutoff crossover (n-point crossover) / Random cutoff point per child crossover / Bag of genes model / Random parent and fitness based gene selection n-point crossover / Random parent and fitness biased 10-point crossover / n-point Random cutoff Random parent Recombination

- Alternative representation of genotype
- Tsjernobyl model: mutation during life -> radiation decreases over time or constant, varying the mutation step size and chance
- What if we let the variation happen because of mutation instead of initialization.
  - Large mutation size at first with high mutation probability -> decrease mutation size
